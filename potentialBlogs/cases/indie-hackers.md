Indie Hackers - Courtland Allen
Main Problem: Developers and designers in his circle only saw VC-funded startup stories, not relatable bootstrapped businesses

Moment of Inspiration: Reading yet another tech blog glorifying venture capital while ignoring profitable small businesses

Biggest Hurdle: Getting busy, successful founders to spend time doing in-depth interviews for free

Prototype: A simple blog with beautifully formatted interviews + a basic forum for discussions

First Customers: Personally reached out to bootstrapped founders he admired. The community grew organically as readers became contributors
