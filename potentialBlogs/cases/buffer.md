Buffer - Joel Gascoigne
Main Problem: Wanted to schedule tweets at optimal times without manual posting

Moment of Inspiration: Frustrated by having to be at his computer at specific times to reach international audiences

Biggest Hurdle: Getting initial traction and convincing people to pay for a social media tool when free alternatives existed

Prototype: A two-page MVP - landing page explaining the concept and a payment page. Built the actual product only after getting paid signups

First Customers: Posted the concept on Hacker News, got 120 signups from the landing page alone. Used content marketing and transparency about revenue to build trust
