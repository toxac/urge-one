Superhuman - Rahul Vohra
Main Problem: Email had become slow, cluttered, and anxiety-inducing despite being the most important communication tool

Moment of Inspiration: After selling his previous company Rapportive, he experienced the pain of email overload at scale

Biggest Hurdle: The incredible technical complexity of building a fast, reliable email client that could handle massive volumes

Prototype: A beautifully designed but extremely limited email client that focused entirely on speed and keyboard shortcuts

First Customers: Used an invite-only waitlist to create scarcity. Targeted tech executives and influencers who felt the email pain most acutely
