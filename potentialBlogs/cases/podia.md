Podia - Spencer Fry
Main Problem: Creators he knew were juggling 5+ different platforms for courses, digital downloads, memberships, and email lists

Moment of Inspiration: Watching his wife (a yoga teacher) struggle to sell her online courses while managing multiple subscriptions

Biggest Hurdle: Convincing creators to switch from specialized "best-in-class" tools to an all-in-one platform

Prototype: A simple digital download platform that gradually added course and membership features based on customer requests

First Customers: Leveraged his existing audience from previous startups. Used content marketing focused on the frustrations of managing multiple platforms
