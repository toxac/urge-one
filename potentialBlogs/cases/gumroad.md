# Gumroad - Sahil Lavingia
## Main Problem
Wanted to sell his own design icons but existing platforms were too complex and took huge commissions

## Moment of Inspiration
While designing Twitter's first mobile app, he created icon sets but couldn't find a simple way to sell them directly to his audience

## Biggest Hurdle
Scaling payments and handling fraud prevention as a solo founder

## Prototype
A weekend project using Stripe's API that let him accept payments and deliver digital files automatically

## First Customers
Posted on Hacker News and Twitter about his simple solution. Other designers in his network immediately wanted to use it too
