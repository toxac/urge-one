# Sizing Up Your Opportunity (Concept)
Objective: Demystify market quantification and introduce the competitive reality.

Main Point: Quantify your potential. You need to know if the market is big enough to achieve your financial goals and if you can realistically win against competitors.

Key Insight: The necessity of breaking down market size into TAM, SAM, and SOM (Total, Serviceable, Share) to get an actionable number.

Core Areas to Cover:

Quantifying Demand (TAM/SAM/SOM): Simple definitions and the purpose of each number.

Competition Reality: How to identify direct rivals and assess their weaknesses (which become your Opportunity).

Barriers to Entry: Identifying external hurdles (cost, regulation) and the competitive landscape.

Action Driver: This data will be calculated and input in the next Exercise to finalize the "head" of the evaluation.
