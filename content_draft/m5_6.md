# M 5.6 Challenge: The First Commitment Ask (M5.4)
Objective: The crucial action step: make the ask for a non-refundable commitment.

Goal: Secure payment or a concrete, non-refundable commitment from 3 people in their inner circle/network.

Task Type: Communicate & Execute (This is a direct real-world challenge).

5. Concept: Analyzing the Sales 'No' (M5.5)
Objective: Teach the user how to process a failed sales ask; using the rejection as valuable data to refine the offer, not the idea.

Main Point: A sales 'no' is different from a general 'no' on a favor. This 'no' is valuable because it tells you something specific about your price, your timing, or your offer's clarity.

Key Insight: Introduce the distinction between a "No to the Offer" (fix your pitch/price) and a "No to the Problem" (kill the opportunity).

Action Driver: This prepares users for the final Milestone 6: Building the Solution based on confirmed demand.

# Templates and Resources
**The Pre-Sale Readiness** (Checklist): A final, simple checklist before they hit "send" or make the call (e.g., "Do I know their name?", "Is the price clear?", "Did I log the starting time?").
**Tracking Your First 3 Asks**(Guide): A structured form/journal entry template to record the results of their 3 commitments attempts, focusing purely on data (Was the reason financial? Did they not believe the guarantee? Was the problem not big enough?).
**Anecdote: My Worst First Sale Pitch** (Inspiration): A personal story from your experience about making a terrible first pitch but surviving and learning from it. (Reinforces "Embrace the Awkward").
