# Exploring Your Market (Concept)
Objective: Introduce the "who" and "where" of the market to replace guesswork with data.

Main Point: Why understanding your market is the absolute foundation of your business (avoiding the "build-it-and-they-will-come" myth).

Key Insight: You can't sell to everyone. Success comes from defining your Ideal Customer Blueprint (the specific person you're building for).

Core Areas to Cover:

Demographics vs. Psychographics: Explain the difference (what they are vs. how they think and live).

Market Signals: What signs (complaints, spending habits, online activity) indicate a market's health and hunger.

Action Driver: This step prepares you to input the primary data points about your target audience in the next Exercise.
