# Concept: Pricing Strategy – Your Value, Defined in Dollars

Alright, you know your **Unit Cost (COGS)** from the last milestone. That’s your financial floor. But here’s a critical **concept** I’ve seen separate successful ventures from those that barely break even: **Pricing is a strategic tool, not just a calculation.**

I’ve seen founders simply add a margin to their costs, only to undersell the immense **value** they’re creating. This **concept** is about moving beyond cost-plus pricing and embracing methods that maximize your **revenue** while keeping your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) irresistible to your target audience. You need to define your price with confidence and clarity.

## Why Pricing is More Than Just Math

Your price is a powerful signal. It tells the customer about the quality, the efficacy, and the expected results of your **MSP**.

* **It Communicates Value:** A price that's too low often signals a weak, ineffective product. A price that's too high signals arrogance or exclusivity. Your price must be strategically aligned with the transformation you provide.
* **It Determines Profitability:** Duh. But seriously, a strategic price ensures you not only cover your costs but also hit your desired **Target Profit Margin** (which you defined in M4).
* **It Dictates Scale:** Your pricing model (one-time fee, subscription, tiered model) dictates your future **sales** stability and how quickly you can grow.

## Your Urge Toolkit: Three Core Pricing Approaches

Forget setting one number. Pricing is a spectrum. We'll focus on three approaches to help you find your sweet spot:

1.  ### Cost-Plus Pricing (The Floor)
    * **Approach:** Calculate your **COGS** (the minimum cost to deliver one unit) and add a fixed percentage margin (your profit).
    * **Insight:** This establishes your *financial floor*—the absolute minimum you can charge without losing money. **Never sell below this number.**
2.  ### Competitor-Based Pricing (The Benchmark)
    * **Approach:** Look at what direct competitors and indirect workarounds are currently charging for a similar solution or the problem itself.
    * **Insight:** This sets your *market benchmark*. If you charge significantly more, you must justify it with superior **value** (e.g., saving more time, offering a better guarantee).
3.  ### Value-Based Pricing (The Ceiling)
    * **Approach:** Determine the *tangible and emotional value* (M4.1) your **MSP** provides to the customer. If your solution saves them \$500 worth of time or makes them \$1,000 more efficient, you price based on a fraction of that benefit.
    * **Insight:** This is the most effective approach. It anchors your price to the customer’s gain, not your cost.
