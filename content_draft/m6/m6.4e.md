  You've defined your minimal build scope. This exercise is about **planning**
  your Critical Path—the exact sequence of steps from sale to delivery. You'll
  document every step and identify potential **bottlenecks** (delays, dependencies),
  ensuring your first customers have a **flawless, reliable** experience.

# Exercise: Map Your Critical Path

Alright, time to get organized! You've made your **Feature Prioritization Cut** and you know what you need to build. This **exercise** is about **planning** the exact operational sequence required to fulfill your pre-sale commitment flawlessly.

I've seen so many projects stall because founders overlooked a small, non-technical dependency—like waiting for a logo or a shipping box. This task ensures you identify every single step and, crucially, every potential **bottleneck** in your delivery chain.

## Your Mission: Design the Flawless Fulfillment System

Your goal is to map the entire process from the moment the payment clears to the moment the **value is delivered** to your first customer. Remember, for V1, **manual is fine, reliable is mandatory.**

### Part 1: Sequence the Steps (End-to-End Map)

Use the interactive list below to map out the 5-7 steps required to fulfill your promise. Start with the payment and end with the customer using the product.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1: Payment Received** | (Start Point) The trigger for your system. | **Run It** | Order Confirmation |
| **Step 2-6: Internal Build/Assembly** | (List Input) The actions you take (e.g., "Manual file generation," "Final code testing," "Packaging product"). | **Execute** | Internal Process |
| **Step 7: Delivery & Confirmation** | (End Point) The final action (e.g., "Send download link," "Ship unit with tracking"). | **Execute** | Fulfillment |
| **Next Step (After Delivery)** | (Text Input) What do you do immediately after delivering (e.g., "Schedule follow-up email for feedback"). | **Communicate** | Feedback trigger |

### Part 2: Identify Bottlenecks (The Weak Links)

A **bottleneck** is any step with an external dependency or a high risk of failure/delay.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biggest External Dependency:** | (Text Input) Identify the single step that relies on someone else or an external system (e.g., "Waiting for supplier lead time," "Payment gateway approval"). | **Analyze** | Defined risk point |
| **Internal High-Friction Step:** | (Text Input) Identify the one step *you* are most likely to procrastinate on or struggle with (e.g., "Writing the final TOS," "Designing the welcome PDF"). | **Think** | Personal risk mitigation |
| **Bottleneck Mitigation Plan:** | (Textarea) What is your simple backup plan or solution for the External Dependency identified above? | **Plan It** | Risk reduction strategy |

## Your Action: Commit to Your Process!

* **Goal:** Have a fully mapped and documented Critical Path saved.
* **Task Type:** **Plan It / Run It**
* **Reminder:** Clarity prevents panic. By mapping the "how," you ensure your first customers have a **flawless, reliable** experience.
