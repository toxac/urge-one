# Exercise: Secure Your Supply Chain and Resources

Alright, you've mapped out your entire **Critical Path**—you know the steps required to deliver your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) flawlessly. This **exercise** is about **executing** the final preparatory steps: securing all the resources needed for your minimal build.

I’ve seen projects stall right here because a founder assumed a material was in stock or a piece of software was free. This task ensures you have verified access to every resource required to keep your promise to those pre-sale customers.

## Your Mission: Verify & Commit Resources

Your goal is to eliminate all remaining risk associated with material supply, technology, and human resource gaps *before* you start the serious **building**.

### Part 1: Acquisition Inventory

Use the form below to list the essential items required for your minimal build and the immediate action you will take to acquire them.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material/Tool Needed:** | (List Input) List the top 3 critical external resources (e.g., specific software license, raw material supply, freelancer for one code block). | **Create** | Resource Definition |
| **Acquisition Commitment:** | (Text Input) What is the very next step you will take to **secure** the most critical resource? (e.g., "Place order with Supplier X," "Purchase subscription to Software Y," "Post job to Upwork"). | **Execute** | Immediate Action Task |
| **Human/Skill Gap Check:** | (Text Input) Is there a step in your Critical Path (from M6.4) you *must* **outsource** or ask your **Cheer Squad** to help with? (If yes, define the role). | **Communicate/Run It** | Delegation/Support need |

### Part 2: Mitigate Build Risks

This final step ensures you have a backup plan for the most critical resource.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Resource Bottleneck:** | (Text Input) Which item from your list has the longest lead time or highest risk of failure? | **Analyze** | Risk identification |
| **Mitigation Plan:** | (Textarea) What is your simple backup plan if this critical resource fails or is delayed by 5 days? (e.g., "Use a cheaper local supplier," "Build a temporary manual workaround"). | **Plan It** | Contingency strategy |
