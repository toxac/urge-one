# Exercise: Feature Prioritization Cut

Alright, time to get your hands dirty! You know the **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) philosophy demands that we **build just enough** to honor your pre-sale commitment. This **exercise** is about **executing** the tough decisions to ensure your precious time and money are spent *only* on features that deliver the core **value**.

You are replacing the overwhelming "to-do list" with a lean, actionable **build list**.

## Your Mission: Commit to the Lean Build

Use the interactive form below to ruthlessly prioritize your tasks. Everything that is *not* absolutely essential to delivering the promised core function must be cut for Version 1.0. This prevents the "overbuilding trap" that kills early momentum.

### Part 1: Defining the Core Scope

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Commitment Feature:** | (Textarea) What is the single, non-negotiable feature required to fulfill your pre-sale promise? (e.g., "A working login and access to the video library"). | **Plan It** | Defines the minimum viable scope. |
| **Build Timeline Estimate:** | (Number Input: Days/Hours) Estimated time (in hours/days) to complete this **minimal** build list. | **Execute** | Sets a realistic time commitment. |
| **Tool Commitment:** | (Text Input) What specific tool/platform will you use to **build** this core feature? (e.g., Webflow, custom JavaScript, Figma). | **Plan It** | Confirms technical path and required resources. |

### Part 2: The Ruthless Cut List

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Nice-to-Have" Cut List:** | (List Input) List 3 features you *want* to build but will **cut** for V1. (e.g., "Social sharing integration," "User profile editing," "Fancy onboarding tutorial"). | **Think** | Commits to scope reduction. |
| **Justification for Cuts:** | (Textarea) Briefly explain *why* cutting these features is crucial for launching on time. | **Analyze** | Reinforces focus on **MSP**. |
