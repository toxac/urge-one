# Exercise: Communicate Your Progress

Alright, time to focus on your **committed buyers**! You've successfully made the sale or secured a commitment (M5) and are now busy **building** your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product). I've seen too many great ventures lose early trust by going silent during this phase.

This **exercise** is about **communicating** proactively. You must manage expectations, maintain excitement, and keep that crucial early trust intact.

## Your Mission: Maintain Trust & Momentum

Your goal is to draft two core communications that will be used during the build phase: one to manage the timeline and one to thank the user and set up the next steps after delivery.

### 1. The Proactive Progress Update

This message is essential if your build is taking longer than initially expected, or just to let them know you haven't forgotten them.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current Status** | (Dropdown: X% Complete, Feature Y Testing, Final Assembly) Commit to a clear status. | **Communicate** | Transparency |
| **Delivery Date Commitment** | (Date Input) Commit to a specific, realistic final delivery date. | **Plan It** | Managing expectations |
| **Progress Update Draft** | (Textarea) Draft a short message (3-5 sentences) focused on *progress* and *value*, not excuses. Remind them of the **benefit** they purchased. | **Create/Communicate** | Trust builder |

### 2. The Post-Sale Thank You & Follow-up

This message is sent immediately upon delivery and sets up the crucial feedback loop.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Thank You Hook** | (Textarea) Draft a personalized thank-you that uses their name and confirms the value delivered. | **Create/Communicate** | Loyalty builder |
| **Next Step for Customer** | (Text Input) What is the single, clear next step they should take with the **MSP**? (e.g., "Check their email for the access link," "Schedule their first session"). | **Execute** | Reduces friction |
| **Feedback Link Plan** | (Text Input) Where will you direct them to leave feedback (e.g., dedicated survey link, reply to this email)? | **Communicate/Run It** | Data acquisition |
