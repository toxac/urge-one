# Concept: Critical Path & Bottlenecks – The Delivery Roadmap

Alright, you've made your ruthless **Feature Prioritization Cut** and you're committed to **building just enough**. That’s excellent execution! But here’s the next critical **concept** for this phase: **The Build and Delivery isn't one big step; it's a sequence of smaller ones.**

I’ve seen founders rush the build, only to realize they forgot a crucial step—like setting up payment processing or securing a specific material—which halts their entire launch. This **concept** is about creating your **Critical Path**, a simple roadmap that forces you to identify every single step and, more importantly, every potential **bottleneck** or weak link in your chain.

## Why Mapping Your Path Prevents Panic

When you map out the process, you replace assumption with clarity. This is essential for meeting your pre-sale commitments (Pillar 3) and protecting your reputation (Pillar 4).

* **Spotting Bottlenecks:** A bottleneck is the slowest or most dependent step in your process (e.g., waiting for material, waiting for software approval). If you don't know where it is, you can't fix it.
* **Predictable Fulfillment:** Your map ensures a smooth, predictable delivery process. This builds trust with your first customers and converts them into advocates.
* **Managing Dependencies:** Some tasks can only start after another one finishes (A depends on B). Your Critical Path highlights these dependencies, ensuring you don't waste time waiting.
* **Focus on Reliability:** In this phase, reliability is more important than speed. Your map ensures every step is covered accurately.

*My take? Don't start building until you know the exact sequence of delivery. The process is the product.*

## Your Urge Toolkit: Mapping the Sequence

Your Critical Path starts the moment the **customer commits** and ends when the **value is fully delivered**.

### 1. Identify Every Single Step

* **Action:** Write down every single manual or technical step required. Think granularly.
    * *Example (Physical Product):* Design Final Packaging → Order Materials → Assemble Unit → Quality Check → Print Shipping Label → Send Tracking.
    * *Example (Digital Service):* Receive Payment → Auto-send Welcome Email → Manually Provision Access → Send Onboarding Guide.
* **Focus:** Include external steps (like "Waiting for Stripe Approval") and internal steps ("Designing the Final Asset").

### 2. Spot the Bottlenecks (The Dragons)

* **Insight:** A bottleneck is typically any step with a **time delay** or an **external dependency**.
* **Approach:** **Analyze** your map. Where could the process break down?
    * **Time-Related:** What tasks take longer than one day (e.g., waiting for material shipment, coding a complex feature)?
    * **External Dependency:** Which step relies on someone else or an external system (e.g., payment gateway approval, freelancer delivery, material supplier)?

### 3. Mitigate the Risk

* **Action:** Once you spot a bottleneck, develop a quick fix. If the supplier is slow, secure a backup. If the code is complex, plan to outsource it.
