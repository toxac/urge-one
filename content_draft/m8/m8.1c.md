# Concept: Retrospective: Goals vs. Reality (M8.1)
Objective: Force a critical review of the entire journey, comparing initial ambitions (M1) against the achieved reality.

Main Point: Success must be measured against your definition, not external metrics (like VC funding). Did this MSP serve your life?

Key Insight: Lifestyle and time goals (personal quality of life) are just as important as revenue goals. Failure to meet time/lifestyle goals means the business model needs adjustment before scaling.

Approach: Think critically and honestly about the trade-offs made during the launch phase.

Action Driver: This prepares the user for the financial reality check that follows.
