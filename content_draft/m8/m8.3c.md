# Concept: The Decision to Scale (M8.3)
Objective: Demystify scaling. It is a decision based on data, not just desire.

Main Point: Scaling means intentionally adding complexity and spending money to increase growth. You should only scale a model that is proven to be profitable and reliable.

Key Insight: Scale only after Consistency. Before scaling, your MSP delivery (M6) and customer acquisition (M7) must be predictable, reliable, and profitable for small numbers.

Core Areas to Cover:

Readiness Check: Is the fulfillment automated? Are the systems in place? Can you handle 10x the customers?

Strategic Growth: What part of the business do you invest in next (Marketing, Product Development, Operations)?

Action Driver: This prepares the user to build their next strategic roadmap.
