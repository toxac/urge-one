## Your Mission: Prove the Math Works

Your goal is to pull your actual **data** from Milestone 7 (Monitoring & Measurement) and combine it with your initial cost definitions (Milestone 4) to calculate the ultimate health metrics.

### Key Metrics to Calculate:

| **Profit Margin Per Unit** | (Number Input) Final calculation of profit generated on each sale. | **Run It** (Calculation) | Confirmed Profitability |

### The Final Test: Go/No-Go

Based on the data you just calculated, you must answer one final question that determines your next move:

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Viability Check** | (Checklist) Confirm: Is your **LTV > CPA**? Is **Profit Margin > Target Margin**? | **Analyze** | Scaling Decision |
