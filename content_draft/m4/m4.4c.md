# Concept: Financial Health – Knowing Your Numbers

Alright, time for a crucial **concept** that separates scalable businesses from expensive hobbies: **Financial Health.** We're not talking about complex accounting—we're talking about knowing your numbers well enough to guarantee profit.

I’ve seen too many brilliant ideas fail because the founder didn't know the basic math of their business. This **concept** is about replacing hopeful guesses with cold, hard reality. You don't need to be a finance genius; you just need to be organized and honest with yourself.

## Why The Math Matters: Profitability is Intentional

Your business is designed to generate **real sales and revenue**. If you don't track the money, you can be busy without being profitable.

* **Unit Economics (The Core Truth):** You must know exactly what it costs you to deliver *one* unit of your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product). This is your **Cost of Goods/Service Sold (COGS)**. If you don't know this, you can't set a viable price.
* **Profitability Filter:** Before you focus on **selling**, you need to ensure that the **value** you sell is greater than the **cost** to create and deliver it.
* **Budget Runway:** You must know how much you can spend (operating budget) to keep the lights on while you prove your **opportunity**. This determines how long you can survive before you *must* generate **real sales**.

*My take? The financial part of your business is your internal audit. You don’t need to be a finance genius; you just need to be organized and honest.*

## Your Urge Toolkit: Calculating Your Cost

Forget complicated spreadsheets. We focus on two simple but powerful calculations:

### 1. Cost of Goods/Service Sold (COGS)

* **What It Is:** The total cost directly tied to delivering **one** unit of your **MSP**.
* **Approach:** Think about all direct costs: materials, supplies, payment processing fees, and the estimated time/labor cost to deliver one unit of service.
* **Action Driver:** This calculation tells you the **floor price**—the absolute minimum you can charge without losing money.

### 2. The Operating Budget

* **What It Is:** The non-COGS money you need to run your business for the next 3-6 months (e.g., website hosting, software subscriptions, initial marketing).
* **Approach:** Be realistic. This budget determines your *runway*—how long you can survive before you *must* generate **real sales** to cover costs.
