## Your Mission: Define Your First Outreach Sprint

Use the interactive form below to commit to your initial marketing and outreach strategy. Remember, you’re focusing on high-impact, low-cost outreach where your ideal customer actually spends time.

### The Blueprint Inputs:

1.  **Primary Outreach Channel:**
    * **Your Task:** Select or name the single most important channel you will use first (e.g., LinkedIn Direct Outreach, Specific Niche Forum, Targeted Email List, etc.). Be specific!
    * *Purpose:* Locks in your focus and ensures you're not spreading effort too thin.

2.  **Why This Channel?**
    * **Your Task:** Briefly explain *why* you believe your ideal customer will see your **Value Proposition** here. Reference your customer research (Pillar 2).
    * *Approach:* Forces you to justify your time investment with **data** and logic.

3.  **Initial Message Hook:**
    * **Your Task:** Draft a concise, personalized outreach message or hook (max 3-4 sentences). This must identify the customer's **pain point** and introduce your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) as the solution.
    * *Reminder:* This is a **Communication** asset. Keep it direct and focused on their benefit.

4.  **Target Acquisition Goal:**
    * **Your Task:** Commit to a specific, direct number of early customers you will attempt to contact this week/sprint. (Keep it small and achievable: 5-10 direct contacts is better than 100 vague emails).
    * *Goal:* Creates a measurable, **actionable target** to drive your **Execute** phase.

5.  **Tracking Method:**
    * **Your Task:** State the simple tool or method you will use to track responses, feedback, and **data** from this initial outreach. (e.g., Simple spreadsheet, Notion table, Trello board).
    * *Purpose:* This ensures you collect and learn from the data, even if the answer is "no."
