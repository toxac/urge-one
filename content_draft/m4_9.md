# M4.9 Concept: Pillar 5: Manage Money & Records (M4.9)
Objective: Demystify business finance into simple concepts for health and growth.

Main Point: Money management isn't complicated accounting; it's about knowing if your business is profitable and sustainable.

Key Insight: You must know your Unit Economics (What does one customer cost you? How much do they pay?). If your profit isn't greater than your acquisition cost, the model is broken.

Core Areas to Cover:

Cash Flow vs. Profit: Simple differentiation between money coming in vs. actual profit.

Essential Record Keeping: What is the absolute minimum documentation (receipts, basic ledger) required for legal/tax purposes (keep it simple).

Setting the Budget: Operating budget for the next 3-6 months to avoid running out of runway.

Action Driver: This primes the user for the financial input in the final Exercise.
