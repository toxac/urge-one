# Deep-Dive into Customer Needs (Concept)
Objective: Teach the user how to move beyond surface-level issues to uncover deep pain points and buying motivations.

Core Areas to Cover:

Pain vs. Gain: How to differentiate between customer frustrations and desired outcomes (gains).

Listening Techniques: Brief advice on how to listen actively, ask "why," and find clues in complaints/reviews.

Action Driver: The insights gathered here will directly inform the fields you fill out in the next Exercise.
