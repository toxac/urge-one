# Exercise: Build Your Funnel (Pillar 2 & 3 Execution)

Alright, you understand that **sales** are a systematic journey, not a random act of marketing! This **exercise** is about **executing** the visualization of that process. You'll map out the actual steps a stranger takes to become an advocate for your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product).

I've seen the biggest revenue leaks happen in the transitions between the funnel stages. By mapping this out, you force yourself to see where you need to build trust and simplify the path to **real sales**.

## Your Mission: Map Your Customer’s Journey

Use the structured form below to design your business's customer journey, detailing the specific assets and communication required at each stage of the funnel.

### Part 1: Funnel Mapping

| Stage | Goal | Action/Asset Required | Task Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Awareness** | Get noticed by the **Target Audience**. | What is the initial **communication** hook/content they see? (e.g., A post on LinkedIn, a forum comment, a search result). | **Explore/Communicate** |
| **2. Consideration** | Convert attention into engagement and trust. | What is the **Landing Page** feature or free guide they use to learn more about the **Value Proposition**? (e.g., Testimonial section, Free Starter Guide). | **Create/Think** |
| **3. Conversion** | Get the sale (secure the commitment). | What is the **single, clear CTA** and the mechanism for payment? (e.g., "Pay Now" button via Stripe, Pre-order form). | **Execute** |
| **4. Loyalty/Advocacy** | Turn paying customers into a **Cheer Squad**. | What is the crucial post-sale **Delivery** and **Feedback** step? (e.g., Personalized thank you email, 3-question survey). | **Run It** |

### Part 2: Key Metrics (Data Focus)

This is the planning for **Pillar 5 (Manage Money)**—you must know what to measure to fix your system later.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acquisition Source:** | (Text Input) Where will you spend the most time/money to drive traffic to the top of the funnel? | **Plan It** | Channel Commitment |
| **Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** | (Number Input & Currency) How much are you willing to spend/invest (time or money) to acquire **one** paying customer? | **Think/Run It** | Budget & Profitability |
| **Biggest Funnel Leak:** | (Textarea) Based on intuition, where do you anticipate the most drop-off (e.g., "People won't click the CTA," "They won't fill out the form")? | **Analyze** | Risk/Bottleneck Identification |
