# Exercise: Build Campaigns (Pillar 2 Execution)

Alright, time for **Execution**! You understand that campaigns are structured experiments, not random shouting. This **exercise** is about building your first few marketing campaigns to drive targeted traffic to your live **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) page.

Iâ€™ve seen too many founders fail here because they didn't structure their test. By planning this now, you ensure every action yields actionable **data** that moves you closer to **real sales**.

## Your Mission: Launch Measurable Experiments

Your goal is to structure two distinct campaigns (Campaign 1 and Campaign 2) to test different messages or channels. This forces you to be systematic and track results.

### Campaign 1: Primary Channel Execution

This uses the Primary Outreach Channel you defined earlier (e.g., LinkedIn).

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Campaign Name** | (Text Input) Give this campaign a clear name (e.g., "LinkedIn Outreach Test," "Niche Forum Post 1"). | **Plan It** | Tracking identifier. |
| **Core Message/Asset** | (Textarea) Draft the final copy/link used for this specific campaign. | **Create/Communicate** | The creative asset being tested. |
| **Launch Date** | (Date Input) When will you launch this specific effort? | **Execute** | Accountability timeline. |
| **Expected CTA** | (Text Input) What single action do you want the user to take? (e.g., Click Link, Reply to Post, Visit Page). | **Think** | Conversion target. |
| **Traffic Target** | (Number Input) How many people do you aim to reach or have view this content? | **Execute** | Reach goal. |

### Campaign 2: Secondary Channel Execution

This uses a different channel or a slightly altered message to test variance.

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Campaign Name** | (Text Input) Give this campaign a clear name (e.g., "Direct Email Test B," "Targeted Hashtag Post"). | **Plan It** | Tracking identifier. |
| **Core Message/Asset** | (Textarea) Draft the final copy/link for this second test. | **Create/Communicate** | The second creative asset. |
| **Launch Date** | (Date Input) When will you launch this specific effort? | **Execute** | Accountability timeline. |
| **Expected CTA** | (Text Input) What single action do you want the user to take? | **Think** | Conversion target. |
| **Traffic Target** | (Number Input) How many people do you aim to reach or have view this content? | **Execute** | Reach goal. |
