# Concept: Collect Feedback – Turn Insights Into Your Next Iteration

Alright, you did it! You successfully fulfilled your first orders. Take a breath—that’s a huge milestone! But here’s a critical **concept** for every scaling business: **Delivery is only 50% of the job; structured feedback is the other 50%.**

I’ve seen founders deliver great **MSPs** but never ask *why* the customer bought it, or *what* almost made them walk away. They miss the most valuable **data** needed for growth. This **concept** is about setting up a simple, non-intrusive system to collect honest, actionable insights that guide your next **build** and ensure your **Value Proposition** is rock solid.

## Why Honest Feedback is Your Growth Lever

Don't wait for your customers to complain—proactively seek their opinion. When you collect structured feedback, you unlock:

* **Undeniable Validation:** You confirm the pain point is gone, and the **value** you promised was delivered.
* **The Blueprint for V2:** Your first customers tell you *exactly* what feature to build next or what communication to fix. They are free R&D.
* **Loyalty & Trust:** Asking for feedback shows you genuinely care about their experience. This is crucial for turning early buyers into strong members of your **Cheer Squad**.
* **Clear Next Steps:** Feedback helps you quickly determine if you should double down, refine your current process, or consider a strategic pivot.

*My take? Feedback is the engine of iteration. Don’t fear criticism; crave it. It’s the fastest way to get to **real sales** at scale.*

## Your Urge Toolkit: Structuring the Ask

The goal is to get raw, honest **data**, not polite compliments. You need to ask the right questions at the right time.

### 1. The Timing Principle

* **Insight:** Ask for feedback when the user has had enough time to *use* the **MSP**, but not so long that they forget the details of the initial problem.
* **Approach:** For a quick service, ask within 24-48 hours. For a program or product that requires setup, wait 5–7 days.

### 2. Focus on Actionable Questions

Avoid generic questions like "How was your experience?" Ask questions that provide **data** for your next **Execution** phase.

* **Focus on the Pain Point:** Did we fix your problem? *("On a scale of 1-10, how much less frustrating is [Problem X] now?")*
* **Focus on Value:** What did they love? *("What is the single most valuable thing our MSP did for you?")*
* **Focus on Friction:** What was difficult or confusing? *("What almost made you not buy, or what was the hardest step in getting started?")*

### 3. Choose the Right Channel

* **Approach:** Start with a simple, personal email or direct message (using the communication asset you drafted in M6.4). Make it easy for them to reply.
* **Avoid Overwhelm:** Don't send a 20-question survey to your first three customers. Use a short, focused survey (3-5 questions maximum).
