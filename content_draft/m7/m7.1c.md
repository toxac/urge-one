# Concept: Soft Launch – Fulfillment is the Ultimate Validation

Alright, this is the moment of truth! You’ve secured commitment(s) and built your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) to fulfill that promise. Now, here’s a critical **concept** for this phase: **Your first delivery is not about revenue—it's about validating your entire system and earning your first cheerleaders.**

I’ve seen founders skip this step, jump straight to marketing, and then panic when 50 orders break their delivery process. We call this a **Soft Launch** because you are deliberately focusing only on fulfilling your pre-sold commitments flawlessly, not aggressively seeking new **sales**.
