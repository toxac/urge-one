Objective: Introduce the final, non-negotiable filter: ensuring the opportunity is sustainable and fulfilling for the user.

Core Areas to Cover:

Risk Reality: Understanding your true appetite for financial/emotional risk.

Alignment Check: Filtering the opportunity against your core motivations and desired lifestyle.
