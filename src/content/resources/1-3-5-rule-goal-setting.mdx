The 1-3-5 Rule is a simple framework to help you prioritize your goals and avoid overwhelm.

## How It Works:
1. **1 Big Goal**: Identify one major goal you want to achieve.
   - Example: "Launch my online store by the end of the year."
2. **3 Medium Goals**: Define three supporting goals.
   - Example: "Design the website, source products, and set up payment processing."
3. **5 Small Tasks**: Break down each medium goal into five actionable tasks.
   - Example: "Research website builders, create a product catalog, and test payment gateways."

## Why It’s Impactful:
The 1-3-5 Rule helps you focus on what’s most important while breaking down big goals into manageable steps.
