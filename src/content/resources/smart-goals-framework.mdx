The SMART framework is a proven method for setting clear, actionable goals. SMART stands for **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**.

## How to Use the SMART Framework:
1. **Specific**: Define your goal clearly. What exactly do you want to achieve?
   - Example: "I want to increase my monthly revenue by 20%."
2. **Measurable**: Identify how you’ll track progress.
   - Example: "I’ll measure revenue using my accounting software."
3. **Achievable**: Ensure your goal is realistic.
   - Example: "I’ll focus on upselling to existing customers to achieve this."
4. **Relevant**: Align your goal with your broader objectives.
   - Example: "Increasing revenue will help me reinvest in my business."
5. **Time-bound**: Set a deadline.
   - Example: "I’ll achieve this within the next 3 months."

## Why It’s Impactful:
The SMART framework provides a structured approach to goal setting, making it easier to track progress and stay motivated.
