Jamie Siminoff, the founder of Ring, started his journey by solving a personal problem: he wanted to know who was at his front door without having to get up. This simple frustration led to the creation of a revolutionary home security product.

## The Problem:
Jamie often missed deliveries because he couldn’t hear the doorbell from his garage workshop. He wanted a way to see and speak to visitors remotely.

## The Solution:
1. **Initial Prototype**: Jamie built a rudimentary device using a webcam and a two-way radio.
2. **Early Validation**: He tested the prototype at home and realized it solved his problem effectively.
3. **Scaling Up**: He refined the product, launched it on crowdfunding platforms, and eventually built Ring into a billion-dollar business.

## Key Takeaways:
- **Solve Real Problems**: Ring was born out of a genuine need, not just a business idea.
- **Start Small**: Jamie’s initial prototype was simple but effective.
- **Iterate and Improve**: He continuously refined the product based on feedback.

## Why It’s Impactful:
This story demonstrates how **solving your own problem** can lead to a successful business. It’s a great example of **customer-centric innovation** and the power of **starting small**.
