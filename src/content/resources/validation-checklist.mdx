Use this checklist to validate your business ideas before investing time and resources.

## Steps:

2. **Identify Your Target Audience**: Who will benefit from your solution?
3. **Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Build a simple version of your product.
4. **Gather Feedback**: Test your MVP with real users.
5. **Iterate**: Refine your idea based on feedback.
