Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk were struggling to pay rent in San Francisco. They decided to rent out air mattresses in their living room to attendees of a design conference.

## The Journey:
1. **Initial Idea**: They created a simple website to offer air mattresses and breakfast (hence the name "AirBed & Breakfast").
2. **Scaling Up**: They expanded the platform to include homes, apartments, and unique stays worldwide.
3. **Global Impact**: Airbnb revolutionized the travel industry and became a **billion-dollar company**.

## Key Takeaways:
- **Start Small**: The founders began with a simple solution to a personal problem.
- **Iterate and Improve**: They continuously refined the platform based on user feedback.
- **Think Big**: What started as a side hustle became a global phenomenon.
