# Challenge: The First Commitment Ask (The Moment of Truth)

## Your Mission: Execute the Sales Loop

You will need to communicate your offer directly and ask for payment. Remember: **Rejection is Data.**

### Action Steps:

1.  **Identify Targets:** Find 3 individuals in your extended network who have the problem you solve. (Don't use your Cheer Squad unless you need to.)
2.  **Make the Ask:** Reach out to all 3 targets using your refined pitch. **You must clearly ask for the commitment.**
3.  **Log the Data:** Immediately after each interaction, log the result in your Journal. *Did they say Yes? Did they say No? What was their reason?*
4.  **Final Commitment:** Log the results of your three asks in the form below.

### Required Data Input (For Journal/Tracking):

| Field | Purpose | Task Type | Data Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commitment Ask Log** | (Form Submission) Record the outcome of the ask (Yes/No/Maybe). | **Execute/Communicate** | Sales conversion **data**. |
| **Reason for No** | (Textarea) If they said no, document the specific reason (price, timing, trust, or problem not big enough). | **Analyze** | Invaluable feedback for iteration. |
