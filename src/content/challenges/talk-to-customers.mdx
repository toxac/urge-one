# Challenge: Talk to Your Potential Customer

Okay, this is it. You've selected your **opportunity**, you've quantified the risk, and you've committed. Now, it's time to **Execute** the final validation. This **challenge** is designed to push you out of your comfort zone by getting you in front of real people.

We know it might feel awkward or even a bit scary—but facing this small initial fear of **communication** and **rejection** is essential for building your resilience muscle.

## Your Mission: Get Raw Data

The goal is not to sell anything yet. The goal is to **listen** and gather unbiased information to confirm that the problem you intend to solve is real, significant, and worth paying for.

### 1. Identify Your Targets (Think)

* **Target:** Find 3-5 individuals who fit your **Ideal Customer Blueprint** (the target market you defined).
* **Preparation:** Draft 3-5 open-ended questions about their experience with the *problem*, not your *solution*. (e.g., "Tell me about the last time you struggled with X.")

### 2. Execute the Conversation (Communicate)

* **Approach:** Reach out via email, social media, or in person. Be honest: "I'm working on a project to solve X problem, and I'd love your honest feedback on your experience."
* **Listen More Than You Talk:** Do not pitch your **MSP** unless they explicitly ask. Your job is to listen for pain points and urgency.

### 3. Log the Data (Execute)

* **Log Book:** Immediately after each conversation, document your key takeaways in your **Journal**.
* **Focus on the "No":** Did they dismiss the problem as minor? Did they mention a simple workaround? That's valuable **data**!

## Your Action: Complete 3 Conversations!

* **Goal:** Successfully complete and document 3 constructive conversations with potential customers.
* **Reminder:** This is about learning, not selling. Every conversation makes you stronger and more knowledgeable.
