# The Coffee Shop Discount Challenge

## Introduction
Asking for things can feel uncomfortable, but it’s a skill every entrepreneur needs. In this challenge, you’ll practice the art of asking by requesting a **discount at a coffee shop**. This simple exercise will help you build confidence, embrace discomfort, and learn to handle rejection gracefully.

## Objective
- **Goal**: Ask for a discount at a coffee shop.
- **Purpose**: Build confidence in asking, embrace discomfort, and learn to handle rejection.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Choose a Coffee Shop**: Pick a coffee shop you’re comfortable visiting. It could be a local café or a chain.
2. **Prepare Your Ask**: Decide what you’ll say. Keep it simple and polite. For example:
   - “Hi, I was wondering if you offer any discounts today?”
   - “Do you have any special deals for first-time customers?”
3. **Make the Ask**: When you order, politely ask for a discount. Smile and maintain a friendly tone.
4. **Handle the Response**:
   - If they say **yes**, thank them and enjoy your discount!
   - If they say **no**, thank them anyway and move on. Remember, the goal is to practice asking, not to get a discount.
5. **Reflect**: After the experience, take a moment to reflect on how it felt. What did you learn?

## Examples and Scenarios
Here are some examples of how you can phrase your ask:
- **At a Local Café**: “Hi, I love your coffee! Do you have any discounts or loyalty programs?”
- **At a Chain**: “Hi, I was wondering if you offer any student or senior discounts?”
- **At a New Place**: “Hi, this is my first time here. Do you have any special deals for new customers?”

## Tips for Success
- **Be Polite and Friendly**: A smile and a positive attitude go a long way.
- **Keep It Simple**: Don’t overthink your ask. Just be clear and direct.
- **Celebrate the Effort**: Whether you get a discount or not, celebrate the fact that you took action.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Overthinking**: Don’t spend too much time rehearsing your ask. Just do it!
- **Taking Rejection Personally**: If they say no, it’s not about you. Thank them and move on.
- **Avoiding the Ask**: The goal is to practice asking, so don’t skip this step even if it feels uncomfortable.

## Reflection
After completing the challenge, take a moment to reflect:
- How did it feel to ask for a discount?
- Did the experience change your perspective on asking for things?
- What’s one thing you can take away from this challenge?

## Next Steps
- **Apply What You’ve Learned**: Use your newfound confidence to ask for things in other areas of your business, like feedback, partnerships, or support.
- **Practice Regularly**: The more you practice asking, the easier it will become.
- **Move to the Next Challenge**: Keep building momentum by tackling the next challenge with confidence.

**Pro Tip**: “Asking is a skill, and like any skill, it gets easier with practice. The more you ask, the more opportunities you’ll create for yourself. Keep going—you’re doing great!”
