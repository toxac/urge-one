## Introduction
Social media is a goldmine for discovering trends and identifying problems. In this exercise, you'll learn how to **analyze trending hashtags and comments** on platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok to uncover opportunities for your business. This will help you stay ahead of the curve and create solutions that resonate with your audience.

## Objective
- **Goal**: Identify trends and problems by analyzing social media platforms.
- **Purpose**: Stay ahead of the competition, uncover new opportunities, and create solutions that align with current trends.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Choose a Platform**: Pick a social media platform to explore. For example:
   - Instagram: Look for trending hashtags and popular posts.
   - Pinterest: Explore trending pins and boards.
   - TikTok: Watch trending videos and read comments.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Look for patterns or recurring themes. For example:
   - What topics are people talking about?
   - What problems are they complaining about?
   - What products or services are getting a lot of attention?
3. **Document Insights**: Write down your observations. Be specific about the trends and problems you identify.
4. **Brainstorm Opportunities**: Think about how you can leverage these trends to create a business idea or improve an existing one.

## Examples and Scenarios
Here are some examples of trends and opportunities:
- **Trend**: #SelfCareSunday (people sharing self-care routines).  
  *Opportunity*: Create a subscription box for self-care products.
