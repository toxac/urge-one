   - "I can't find affordable, healthy meal options near me."
3. **Brainstorm Solutions**: Think about how you could solve these problems. What products or services could make your life easier?
4. **Validate Your Ideas**: Share your ideas with others. Do they face similar problems? Would they use your solution?
