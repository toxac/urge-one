Alright, you’ve taken the plunge and joined Urge – that takes guts! Now, it’s time to really nail down what’s driving you. This isn’t about some textbook definition; it’s about what truly fuels *your* fire, that deep-down **urge** that pushes you forward.

I've seen it firsthand: when you know your "why," you’ve found your superpower. It’s what keeps you going when things get tough, and trust me, they will. This exercise is about getting that fuel down on paper.

## Your Mission: Find Your Core Motivation

Ready to get started? Your mission is to use the prompts below to explore what makes your entrepreneurial heart tick. This is for *you*, so be honest. Don't overthink it; just put down what genuinely comes to mind.

1.  **Your Fundamental Need:**
    First up, let’s complete this sentence: **"I want to start a business because fundamentally I need to ______."**
    * *My take:* This isn't about grand statements. It's about that honest, core driver. Financial freedom? Creative expression? Solving a nagging problem? What's the deep-down, non-negotiable urge? Just fill in the blank.

2.  **The Feelings of Success:**
    Next, when you picture your business being a success, what feelings bubble up? Which emotions feel really important to you?
    * **Your Task:** Take a look at the options in the form below and pick up to three that truly hit home. If "Other" feels right, go ahead and tell us what that is! These feelings are your inner guidance system – pay attention to them.

3.  **Your North Star Vision:**
    Now, let's fast forward a bit. Imagine your business is thriving, five years down the road. What does a perfect day look like *for you*?
    * **Your Task:** Forget the fancy titles or the size of your company for a second. Focus on how you're spending your time, how you feel, and the kind of impact your business is having on your life and potentially others. Paint us a picture. *I'm talking at least 50 characters here – really make yourself see it. This vision will be your undeniable North Star.*

4.  **Your Non-Negotiables:**
    On the flip side, what are your absolute non-negotiables? What would make you say, "Nope, not worth it," even if the business was making money?
    * **Your Task:** These are your boundaries, the things you won't compromise on. Jot those down in the form. Protecting these is key to long-term fulfillment.

## Quick Urge Tips for This Exercise:

* **Be Real:** This is *your* fuel. Answer honestly. No need to impress anyone! Authenticity is your superpower.
* **Keep It Simple:** Your "why" doesn't need to be a grand philosophical statement. A simple sentence or core feeling is incredibly powerful.
* **Let It Guide You:** When things inevitably get tough, come back to this. Let your "why" be your compass that points you in the right direction.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Dodge:

* **Ignoring Your Gut:** If something feels off about a business opportunity in relation to your "why," *listen*. Your intuition is often right.
* **Trying to Be Someone Else:** Your motivations are uniquely yours. Don't try to fit into someone else's entrepreneurial mold. Build *your* business, *your* way.
* **Setting It and Forgetting It:** Your "why" can evolve as you do. Check in with it now and then, especially after big wins or tough setbacks.
