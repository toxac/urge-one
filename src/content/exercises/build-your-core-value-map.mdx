3.  **Customer Gains:** (Text input) List the top 3 positive outcomes, benefits, or emotions they are seeking.

### Part 2: Define Your Offer (The Square)

4.  **MSP / Products & Services:** (Text input) List the specific features or services of your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product). Keep this minimal!
