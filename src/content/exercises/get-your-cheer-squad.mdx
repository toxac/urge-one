Building a business is easier with a support system. In this exercise, you'll **identify and invite your cheer squad**—friends, family, or mentors who can encourage and support you on your entrepreneurial journey. Having a strong support network will keep you motivated, accountable, and resilient.

<ContentModal client:load buttonText="Read Instructions">
## Objective
- **Goal**: Build a support system of people who will cheer you on.
- **Purpose**: Stay motivated, accountable, and resilient as you build your business.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Identify Your Cheer Squad**: Make a list of people who can support you. For example:
   - Friends or family members who believe in you.
   - Mentors or colleagues with relevant experience.
   - Accountability partners who share similar goals.
2. **Reach Out**: Invite them to be part of your cheer squad. Be clear about how they can support you. For example:
   - "I'm starting a new business and would love your encouragement and feedback."
   - "Can we check in weekly to keep each other accountable?"
3. **Set Expectations**: Define how often you'll connect and what kind of support you need. For example:
   - Weekly check-ins to discuss progress.
   - Occasional brainstorming sessions to refine ideas.
4. **Show Gratitude**: Thank your cheer squad for their support. A little appreciation goes a long way!

## Examples and Scenarios
Here's an example of building a cheer squad:
- **Friend**: "I'd love your encouragement as I work on my new business. Can we chat every Friday?"
- **Mentor**: "Your experience would be invaluable to me. Can we meet once a month to discuss my progress?"
- **Accountability Partner**: "Let's keep each other on track by sharing our goals and checking in weekly."

## Tips for Success
- **Be Specific**: Clearly communicate how your cheer squad can support you. The more specific you are, the better they can help.
- **Reciprocate**: Offer to support your cheer squad in return. Building a strong network is a two-way street.
- **Stay Consistent**: Regular check-ins will keep you accountable and motivated.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Not Asking for Help**: Don't be afraid to reach out. Most people are happy to support you if you ask.
- **Ignoring Feedback**: Listen to your cheer squad's advice and feedback. They can provide valuable insights.
- **Overloading Your Squad**: Be mindful of their time and energy. Don't expect too much too soon.

## Reflection
After completing the exercise, take a moment to reflect:
- Who is in your cheer squad? How can they support you?
- How do you feel knowing you have a support system?
- What's one action you can take today to strengthen your cheer squad?

## Next Steps
- **Take Action**: Reach out to your cheer squad and set up your first check-in.
- **Stay Connected**: Regularly update your squad on your progress and challenges.
- **Move to the Next Exercise**: Keep building your skills by tackling the next exercise.

**Pro Tip**: "A strong support system is like a safety net—it catches you when you fall and lifts you higher when you soar. Build your cheer squad and watch your confidence grow!"
