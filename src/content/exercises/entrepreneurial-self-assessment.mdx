2. **Identify Weaknesses**: Be honest about areas where you need improvement. For example:

3. **Set Goals**: Based on your assessment, set specific goals for growth. For example:
   - "I will improve my financial planning by taking an online course."

4. **Create an Action Plan**: Break your goals into actionable steps. For example:
   - Research online courses on financial planning.
