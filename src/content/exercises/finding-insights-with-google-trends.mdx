## Introduction
Google Trends is a powerful tool for uncovering rising topics and identifying potential opportunities. In this exercise, you'll learn how to **use Google Trends** to analyze search patterns and discover what people are interested in. This will help you stay ahead of the curve and create solutions that align with current demand.

## Objective
- **Goal**: Use Google Trends to identify rising topics and opportunities.
- **Purpose**: Stay ahead of the competition, uncover new opportunities, and create solutions that align with current trends.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Explore Google Trends**: Visit [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) and start exploring. You can search for specific topics or browse trending searches.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Look for patterns or spikes in search interest. For example:
   - What topics are currently trending?
   - Are there any seasonal trends or recurring themes?
3. **Document Insights**: Write down your observations. Be specific about the trends and opportunities you identify.
4. **Brainstorm Opportunities**: Think about how you can leverage these trends to create a business idea or improve an existing one.

## Examples and Scenarios
Here are some examples of trends and opportunities:
- **Trend**: Rising interest in plant-based diets.  
  *Opportunity*: Create a line of plant-based snacks or meal kits.
- **Trend**: Increased searches for home workout equipment.  
  *Opportunity*: Develop a platform that connects users with affordable home workout gear.
