# Milestone 6: Solution – Executing the Build

Alright, stop and celebrate: **You got the commitment!** You've completed the pitch, priced your offer, and secured your first **real sales** signal. You are officially past the hardest part—the analysis and the ask.

This milestone is a strategic transition: **From Pitch Deck to Product.**

I've seen so many founders ruin this moment by falling into the **Overbuilding Trap**—they secure a \$50 pre-sale and spend the next six months building a \$50,000 product. Not you.

This milestone is entirely focused on **Execution** and the **MSP** philosophy: **Build just enough, deliver flawlessly, and secure the revenue engine.**

## The Build Phase: Keep It Lean and Real

You only need to **build** what is necessary to honor the commitment you secured in Milestone 5. The rest is bloat.

### 1. The Build Filter: Ruthless Cuts

* **Focus:** Eliminate every feature that doesn't directly solve the customer's core **pain point** and deliver the promised **value**.
* **Outcome:** You will finalize a lean build list and commit to a rapid, functional timeline.

### 2. Operational Mastery: Flawless Delivery

* **Focus:** Design your **Critical Path** (the sequence of steps from sale to delivery) and secure all your resources.
* **Key Insight:** For your first few customers, **manual is fine, reliability is mandatory.** You must create a predictable fulfillment process that builds instant trust.

### 3. Final Integration: The Revenue Engine

* **Focus:** Force the final technical steps: successfully integrating the payment button and preparing your systems for handling **real sales** data.
* **Outcome:** Your **MSP** will be built, your delivery system will be tested, and your **Revenue Engine** will be active.
