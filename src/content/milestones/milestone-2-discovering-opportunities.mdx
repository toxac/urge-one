Welcome to Milestone 2! This is where the real fun begins—searching for opportunities that have the potential to grow into amazing businesses. But how do we find those opportunities?  

Here’s the secret: It all starts with understanding **value**.  

---

## **What’s This Milestone About?**  

In this milestone, we’ll learn how businesses create value, how solving problems leads to great opportunities, and how to become a person who thinks like a problem solver. If you’ve ever thought, *“I want to start something, but I don’t know what,”* this milestone is your answer!  

---

## **What Will You Learn?**  

1. **What is Value?**  
   We’ll start by breaking down what value means in a business. Value is what makes people excited to pay for something—it solves a problem, makes life better, or fulfills a need or desire. You’ll learn how to spot what people value and how to connect it to what matters to you.  

2. **Solving Problems = Great Opportunities**  
   Did you know that most successful businesses solve problems? In this milestone, you’ll train yourself to see the world differently. Frustrations? Inconveniences? Gaps in what’s available? These are all clues to finding your next big idea.  

3. **Becoming a Problem Solver**  
   A big part of being an entrepreneur is seeing problems as opportunities. We’ll help you develop a problem-solving mindset so you can turn everyday challenges into exciting ideas.  

4. **Practical Approaches to Discovering Value**  
   We’ll explore simple, practical ways to uncover valuable opportunities, like:  
   - Solving your own problems  
   - Observing the needs of people around you  
   - Using your skills to create solutions  
   - Casting a wider net to explore ideas from different industries  

5. **Early Validation of Opportunities**  
   Finding an opportunity isn’t enough—you need to know if it’s worth pursuing. Does the problem excite you? Do people want your solution? Are they willing to pay for it? We’ll show you how to answer these questions early, so you can focus on the best ideas.

## **Why Is This Important?**  

Great businesses don’t just happen—they start with valuable opportunities. This milestone will help you uncover ideas that aren’t just interesting but have the potential to solve real problems and make a difference.  

It’s not about finding a perfect idea right away. It’s about learning the skills and mindset to keep finding and testing ideas until you hit the one that feels *just right*.  

---

## **Your Goal for This Milestone**  

By the end of this milestone, you’ll have a clear understanding of what value is, a list of problems worth solving, and practical tools to test if those ideas are worth pursuing. You’ll feel confident about taking your first steps toward turning those ideas into something real.
