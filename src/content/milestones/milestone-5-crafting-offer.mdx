Stop and celebrate! You've done the rigorous work of **evaluation** (M3) and defined your **Business Blueprint** (M4). You know your costs, you know your customers, and you know the math works.

This milestone is the **commercial pivot point**. We are transitioning your verified **opportunity** from a stable plan into a tangible, purchasable product. Your focus is moving entirely from *analysis* to **sales and commitment.**

I’ve seen incredible ventures stall because they were afraid to ask for money. We’re going to fix that.

## The Commercial Focus: From Blueprint to Commitment

This phase forces you to be brave and put a price tag on your **value**. We believe in **pre-selling**—securing commitment *before* the final **MSP** is built. Why? Because the fastest way to learn is to see if someone will pay you.

### What You Will Achieve:

1.  **Define Your Price:** Move beyond cost calculation (M4) to set a profit-driving **price** based on the **value** you deliver.
2.  **Package the Irresistible Offer:** You'll wrap your price in clear terms, a strong guarantee, and compelling bonuses to eliminate the customer's risk.
3.  **Create Your Sales Asset:** You will **create** your primary sales tool—a high-conversion landing page—and the pitch copy to drive traffic to it.
4.  **Secure the First Commitment:** You will **execute** the crucial "ask" challenge to secure your first **real sales** commitment, confirming true market willingness to pay.

Your journey is about to get financially real. Let's get started with **Pricing Strategy**.
