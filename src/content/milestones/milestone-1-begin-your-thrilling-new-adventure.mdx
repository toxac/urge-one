Forget what you think you need to start a business – the fortune, the fancy degree, or some secret handshake. Here at Urge, we know the real secret: your drive and willingness to get busy. That's it. From my own experience building and advising businesses, I've seen countless brilliant minds get stuck before they even begin. So, we built Urge to cut through the noise and get you **moving**.

We're not just throwing business buzzwords at you. We're here to build your confidence, sharpen your "ask muscle," and give you a real-world roadmap that focuses on actual **sales and revenue**, not just pitch decks. Your success isn't a lottery ticket; it's a recipe we'll cook up together.

This first milestone, **"Light Your Spark,"** is all about igniting that initial motivation and setting you on a path of confident action. Starting something new can feel like staring at a blank page, but here's the deal: every single entrepreneur starts somewhere. We'll break down the journey into manageable steps, showing you exactly what to do and helping you prove to yourself what you're truly capable of.

## Here’s what you'll truly need to make the most of this milestone (and beyond):

* **Action Over Perfection:** Stop overthinking. The less you plan and the more you *do*, the faster you'll learn. Perfectionism is a dream killer.
* **Embrace the Awkward:** Taking that first step, asking for something, or putting your idea out there feels weird. Lean into it. That's where the growth happens.
* **Consistency is King (or Queen!):** You don't need to work 24/7. A few focused hours each week, consistently applied, will build incredible momentum.

## Here’s what you'll gain in this milestone, beyond just the basics of starting:

* **Unshakeable Mindset:** We'll bust those common myths holding you back and equip you with a "can-do" attitude that laughs in the face of fear.
* **Your Core Fuel:** You'll uncover the deep motivations driving your entrepreneurial dreams. This 'why' will be your rocket fuel when things get tough.
* **Real-World Momentum:** You'll set immediate, tangible goals that are *actually* doable, not just abstract ideas. These aren't just thoughts; they're the first bricks in your business.
* **Proof You're a Starter:** You'll have tackled meaningful tasks, showing yourself, unequivocally, that you *can* take that first leap. It's within your reach.

This isn't your average course; it's a hands-on adventure designed to get you moving and building from day one. So, if you're ready to roll up your sleeves and truly get started, you're exactly where you need to be. Your journey to building something amazing starts now. Ready? Your first step awaits...
