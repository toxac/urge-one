# Milestone 3: Evaluation – From Potential to Commitment

Alright, stop and acknowledge this achievement: you’ve finished the hard work of discovering **opportunities**! You now have a solid list of genuine, problem-solving ventures. That's fantastic.

But here’s the next critical step: **you can’t build them all.**

I’ve seen too many great **opportunities** fail because founders got stuck in the wrong one—one that didn't align with their skills, their finances, or their desired lifestyle. This milestone is your ultimate **risk reduction and clarity phase.**

We are going to move beyond enthusiasm and use **data** and logic to critically assess your options. By the time you complete this milestone, you will make the most important executive decision yet: **committing to ONE opportunity** that is truly right for you, right now.

## The Evaluation: Is This Opportunity Solid?

Your framework for evaluation is built on three crucial filters:

### 1. The Market Filter (The Head Check)

You must verify that your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) has enough room to grow and is ready to compete.

* **Key Focus:** Quantifying market size (TAM/SAM/SOM), understanding the competitive landscape, and spotting those critical **barriers to entry**.

### 2. The Personal Filter (The Gut Check)

The best opportunity in the world is the one that aligns with *you*.

* **Key Focus:** Objectively assessing your personal fit—**skills, resources, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.** If the venture clashes with your desired lifestyle, it's not a success, no matter the revenue.

### 3. The Validation Filter (The Reality Check)

Before you commit to **building**, you must test demand.

* **Key Focus:** Making the final commitment, and then immediately pushing the **Challenge: Talk to Your Potential Customer** to confirm that the problem is real and that people are willing to pay for the solution.

This milestone will guide you through sequential concepts and exercises, ensuring you gather all the **data** needed for your final executive decision.
