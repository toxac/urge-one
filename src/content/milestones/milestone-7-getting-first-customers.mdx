# Milestone 7: Customers – Getting Your First Customers

Alright, stop and celebrate: You successfully **built** your **MSP** (Minimal Sell-able Product) and honored your first commitments! That’s an enormous victory.

This milestone is a strategic pivot: **from Fulfillment to Find Customers.** We are moving beyond your inner circle and proving that your **MSP** can generate **real sales and revenue** predictably. Your focus shifts entirely to **execution and data**.

## The Acquisition Challenge: Prove Your Model

The market has confirmed your **Value Proposition** works. Now, you need to prove your model can scale. This phase is built on a tight, iterative loop:

1.  **Validate the System:** First, execute a flawless **Soft Launch** to confirm your delivery process is reliable.
2.  **Generate Data:** Structure your **marketing** efforts as controlled, measurable **experiments**.
3.  **Optimize:** Rigorously monitor your **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** and **Conversion Rate (CR)** to see *what* message works and *where* your best customers are found.

This continuous feedback loop is what transforms a successful idea into a scalable business.

## What You Will Achieve:

### 1. **Execution Mastery:**

You will **execute** your first targeted marketing campaigns, moving beyond hopeful outreach to systematic customer acquisition. You will commit to specific channels and messages based on your **Target Audience** data (M3).

### 2. **Data-Driven Confidence:**

You will establish a monitoring system (Pillar 5) to track the only metrics that matter: **revenue** and **cost**. This confirms that your **MSP** is profitable and ready for the next phase of growth.

### 3. **Process Refinement:**

You will actively solicit and use customer **feedback** to make improvements to your **MSP** and fulfillment process, ensuring every new customer becomes a dedicated advocate (**Cheer Squad** member).
