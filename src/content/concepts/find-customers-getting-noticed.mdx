# Concept: Find Customers – Getting Noticed (Pillar 2)

Alright, you’ve put in the work! You know the **value** you're creating (Pillar 1) and your price floor (Pillar 5). But here’s a critical **concept** for every first-time founder: **A great product with zero customers is just an expensive hobby.** This pillar is about shifting your focus from **building** to **communicating**—and doing it with laser precision.

I've seen so many founders launch something amazing, only to whisper about it on social media and wonder why no one buys. That's not marketing; that's hope. This **concept** is about replacing hope with a practical, focused plan to find the people who are actively looking for the problem you solve. This isn't about expensive ad campaigns; it's about smart, targeted outreach.

## Why Marketing is Your Next Execution Step

You must move beyond your inner circle to find sustained, scalable revenue. Marketing isn't shouting; it's efficiently connecting your **Value Proposition** to your **Target Audience** (who you already defined in M3).

* **The Efficiency Check:** You need to find the cheapest, most efficient channels for acquiring customers. This is essential for keeping your **Cost of Acquisition (CPA)** lower than your profit margin.
* **Proving the Market:** Your initial marketing efforts serve as a final **validation** tool. You are testing whether strangers—not just friends—will engage.
* **It's a System:** Marketing is a measurable system. If you run structured experiments, you get **data** that tells you exactly where to spend your energy next.

*My take? Stop whispering about your **MSP** and start broadcasting to the people who genuinely need it. But do it strategically.*

## Your Urge Toolkit: Choosing the Right Channel

Choosing a marketing channel isn't about being everywhere; it's about being **laser-focused** on where your Ideal Customer is actively looking for a solution.

### 1. Intent vs. Interruption (The Two Channels)

* **Intent-Based (Searching):** These customers are actively looking for a solution *right now*. They are high-value.
    * **Examples:** Google Search (SEO/Ads), specialized forums, product marketplaces.
    * **Strategy:** Your message must match their search intent perfectly.
* **Interruption-Based (Browsing):** These customers are scrolling and need to be stopped by compelling content that highlights their pain point.
    * **Examples:** Social Media (Instagram, LinkedIn), targeted newsletters.
    * **Strategy:** You need sharp messaging and a strong hook to cut through the distraction.

### 2. The Outreach Principle (Your Low-Cost Secret)

* **Insight:** Personal outreach often beats broad advertising for your first 10 **real sales**. It's cheap, authentic, and provides immediate feedback.
* **Approach:** Start small. **Execute** a plan to personally contact 5-10 people who fit your ideal customer profile this week. Ask for feedback, not money (yet). This is how you refine your pitch and find early adopters.
