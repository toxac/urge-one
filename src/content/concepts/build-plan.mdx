# Concept: MSP: The Minimal Build Plan – Keep the Promise

Alright, congratulations! You successfully converted belief into commitment by securing your first pre-sale(s). That’s huge! Now, here’s the most important **concept** of this milestone: **you only build what is absolutely required to keep that promise.**

I’ve seen more fantastic **opportunities** die from founders **overbuilding** than from any lack of money. They waste months adding features no one asked for. This **concept** is about adopting the **Minimal Sell-able Product (MSP)** philosophy: **Be ruthless in your cuts.**

## The MSP Philosophy: Only Build What You Must

Your pre-sale pitch defined the core **value** the customer paid for. Your build list should be a reflection of that, and nothing else.

* **Avoid Feature Creep:** Every extra feature you add that doesn't directly contribute to the **core value exchange** is a tax on your time, energy, and cash. It slows your launch and dilutes your focus.
* **Functional Over Flawless:** Your **MSP** doesn't need to be polished, beautiful, or automated. It needs to **work**. Focus on functionality for V1; think rough draft, not final manuscript.
* **The Fastest Path to Data:** The sooner you deliver your **MSP** and fulfill your commitment, the sooner you get real-world **data** on what customers *actually* use and *actually* need next. Waiting means guessing.

*My take? The biggest killer of early-stage startups is building features no one asked for. Be ruthless in your cuts.*
