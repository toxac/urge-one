I’ve seen founders achieve amazing early **sales** only to lose that momentum—or face penalties—because they ignored the simple administrative and legal foundations. This isn’t about lawyers and auditors yet; it’s about establishing the minimum viable legal and payment infrastructure to safely handle money and customers. This is your foundation of **trust**.

## Your Urge Toolkit: Minimum Viable Compliance

We're not building a complex legal team; we're establishing the essential protection you need for your **MSP**.

### 1. Payments Integration (The Cash Register)

* **Insight:** You need a simple, reliable, and trustworthy way for customers to pay you.
* **Approach:** **Execute** the integration of a simple, hosted payment solution (like Stripe Checkout or PayPal). This allows you to collect money securely and legally.
* **Action Driver:** The goal is a live, working "Pay Now" button tied to your bank account.

### 2. Taxes (The Non-Negotiable)

* **Insight:** Taxes can be complex, but for initial sales, focus on collection and organization.
* **Approach:** **Think** about your immediate obligation (e.g., local sales tax, VAT, GST). Use your basic financial ledger (from M4.10) to track **revenue** and expenses clearly.
* **Action Driver:** Know your basic tax rate and ensure you collect/record it correctly for your first 10 **sales**.

### 3. Legal Basics (The Trust Documents)

* **Insight:** Every customer needs to know the rules of engagement and how you use their data.
* **Approach:** **Create** clear, accessible **Terms of Service** (TOS) and a **Privacy Policy**. These documents set your refund policy, protect your content, and assure customers that their data is safe.
* **Action Driver:** Ensure these documents are linked prominently on your sales page and checkout flow.

### 4. Admin Checklist

* **Insight:** Being organized now saves you massive stress later.
* **Approach:** **Execute** a simple system for managing customer communication, filing receipts, and backing up key project files.
