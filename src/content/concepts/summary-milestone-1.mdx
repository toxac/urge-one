## Congratulations on Completing Milestone 1!

You’ve made it through the first stage of your entrepreneurial journey. You’ve laid the foundation by taking action, addressing mental barriers, and setting clear intentions. Now, it’s time to take a step back and reflect on your progress.

## Reflect on Your Journey So Far

This is your opportunity to assess everything you’ve learned and accomplished in Milestone 1. From understanding your motivations to overcoming fears and taking those first bold steps, each activity has been designed to prepare you for the challenges ahead. Take a moment to pause and think about the following:

1. **Your Why:**
   - How have your motivations evolved since the start of the program? Do you feel more connected to your entrepreneurial purpose?
   - Has this milestone helped you get clearer on why you want to start your business?
2. **Overcoming Mental Blocks:**
   - What mental obstacles did you overcome? Think about how you felt before and after completing challenges like the **Compliment Challenge**, **Discount Challenge**, and others.
   - Reflect on any moments where you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone. How did that feel, and how can you use that courage moving forward?
3. **Progress Towards Action:**
   - Have you noticed yourself taking action more consistently? Are you getting better at prioritizing action over overthinking or fear of failure?
   - How did the **5-Minute Blitz** or **Imperfect Action** Challenge help you break through your procrastination or perfectionism?
4. **Your Strengths & Growth Areas:**
   - What skills and strengths have you identified so far? Reflect on your entrepreneurial self-assessment and how this helps you choose the right business ideas to pursue.
   - Where do you feel you still need to grow? What resources or support might help you in those areas?
5. **Your Support Network:**
   - How did the **Accountability Power-Up** activity work for you? Did you invite friends or family to support your journey? How do you think having this accountability will help you stay motivated?
   - What role does your community play in your business-building process, and how can you engage with others moving forward?

## Looking Ahead

Now that you’ve completed Milestone 1, take a moment to think about what’s next. The journey has just begun, and there’s a lot more to discover, learn, and build. Here’s a sneak peek into what’s coming up:

- **Discovering Opportunities (Milestone 2):**
  You’ll begin identifying potential opportunities and understanding the problems people face. This is where you’ll start testing your ideas and seeing what resonates.
- **Evaluating & Picking the Right Opportunity (Milestone 3):**
  Learn how to evaluate business ideas based on customer needs, your strengths, and market potential. This milestone will help you select the most viable opportunities.

#### **Action Steps Moving Forward**

- **Apply What You’ve Learned:** Use your new understanding of your motivations and strengths to help you make better decisions as you move forward.
- **Stay Accountable:** Keep engaging with your support squad and continue tracking your progress in the app. You’ve already taken a huge step in the right direction!
- **Don’t Stop Now:** Milestone 1 was just the beginning. Keep up the momentum, and keep your eyes on the prize.

#### **Your Next Task:**

Take a few moments to fill out your reflection journal in the app. Think about your personal journey, your growth, and how you want to move forward in Milestone 2. Remember, this reflection is a tool for your growth, and the more honest and thoughtful you are, the better it will serve you.
